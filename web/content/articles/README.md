Welcome! This [pelican](https://getpelican.com/) site includes articles written with [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/). The articles have to be viewed individually to have the pyscript core load, as it's not loaded for non-article pages. You can view the pelican theme used [here](https://github.com/Skenvy/advent-of-code-explainer/tree/main/web/theme).

This site is a learning exercise / PoC. You can read the full [devlog here](https://github.com/Skenvy/advent-of-code-explainer/blob/main/devlog.md) and the [README here](https://github.com/Skenvy/advent-of-code-explainer/blob/main/README.md). Or read the TL;DR excerpt of the devlog here:
> ... the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual fun code challenge exercise, done as an advent calender, so every December. Of course, part of the fun is finding something to use it as an excuse to learn, beyond the scope of just solving the actual puzzles.
>
> This year I've decided to use Advent of Code as an excuse to play around with publishing a [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) package and then using it in a static site that loads [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/). There are plenty of sites out there already that act as sites you can paste your input into and get the solution for, so this isn't trying to be the best at that thing, it's purely just to learn and play around with having one repo host the code for a package, and also the static site (generation) that consumes that package via [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/).
