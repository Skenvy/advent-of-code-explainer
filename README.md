# [advent-of-code-explainer](https://github.com/Skenvy/advent-of-code-explainer)

> [!CAUTION]
> Very WIP PoC. The goal is to eventually be an app that can be used to answer / explain Advent of Code puzzles, but the primary utility for myself making this, is to experiment with setting up a deployment of a package that is then also used in a deployment of a pyscript-centric static site. As part of the PoC, to figure out and eventually understand how best to glue these two intents together (package, that can be used in a pyscript page), this wont yet resemble what it eventually should.

An "explainer" app for "Advent of Code" puzzles.
